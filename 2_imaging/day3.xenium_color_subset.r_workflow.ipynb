    "Nuclei expansion in cell segmentation refers to the process of enlarging the segmented nuclei regions to approximate the boundaries of the entire cells. This technique is used to better represent the actual cell boundaries when only the nuclei have been explicitly segmented/we only have DAPI and no additional cell boundary staining. The primary goal is to provide a more accurate estimation of the cellular area, which is crucial for various downstream analyses in spatial transcriptomics and single-cell studies. In this case, nuclei expansion is constrained either by maximum distance or other nearby cells - so, where there are no other nearby cells to “bump into”, the expansion generates artificially bigger cells."
